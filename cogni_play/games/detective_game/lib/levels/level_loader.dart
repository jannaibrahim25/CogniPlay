/*
plan for this file:
- load a new level from json file
  - figure out how to read a json file
  - call location based or pattern based from input
- track the number of times a level is played (store in a variable or something)
- user clicking input
  - selecting places, user is a point but we will show a circle
  - needs to be a certain radius from center of object, depends on object size
  - submit and back and pause and stuff like that
- something that blocks the entire screen when objects disappear
- need to make objects disappear and know their location
  - so we need to have object dart files
- placing the objects and giving them locations
  - can make a grid? or just randomize but then need to check for overlap
  - instead of grid just have a few set spots they can be in
    - if we do this then add set coordinates to json file
    - in terms of scenery, this makes the most sense for object placement
    - this way objects won't just be floating randomly
